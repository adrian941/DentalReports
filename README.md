Dental Reports is a Blazor WASM project, it provides a user-friendly cloud platform for uploading and viewing dental patient files or data. 

I implemented Microsoft Authentication for secure login. 

Additionally, I developed a 3D file viewer for enhanced visualization with the JS library: Three.js.

Technologies used: 
- ASP.NET Core Hosted Service, Blazor WASM, 
- Microsoft SQL
- Dependency Injection, Entity Framework
- RESTful API
- HTML, CSS, Javascript

Role-based API:
I've created APIs and controllers that handle role-based access. Users only have access to resources corresponding to their roles, thus ensuring security.
